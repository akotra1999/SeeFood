# SeeFood

DESCRIPTION: It's Saturday night, and your friend group needs to decide quickly on a restaurant. The process of searching and reviewing multiple restaurants takes time, especially when multiple cuisine types are requested. 

SeeFood will solve this problem by finding the best-fit restaurant based on your preferences.
